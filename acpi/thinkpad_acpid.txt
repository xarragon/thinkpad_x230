Lenovo Thinkpad X230 ACPID Scripts
==================================
These scripts work for me running Debian Jessie AMD64 with backported
kernel 4.3.0. I do not have PulseAudio installed, running only ALSA.

Currently only muting, volume up and down is implemented.

Copy the event definition script (tpbtns-acpi) into /etc/acpid/events
and the action script (tpbtns.sh) into /etc/acpid/actions.

Restart ACPID:
$ sudo systemctl restart acpid

You should now be able to lower, raise and mute the master volume.


Debugging the scripts:

Add 'set -x' to the action script, then run ACPID in the foreground:

Stop ACPID temporarily:
$ sudo systemctl stop acpid

Launch ACPID in debug mode (will remain in foreground):
$ sudo /usr/sbin/acpid --debug --logevents

You can now see everything that happens. Fix issues, remove debug
output from scripts and then restart ACPID:

$ sudo systemctl start acpid
